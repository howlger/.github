# Brainstorming session in Hackathon

This is a transcript of the result of the brainstorming session that took place in one of the Hackathons in SAP.
The goal of the session was to come up with a prioritized list of desired features when looking at possible future implementations of SWT.

## Disclaimer
This list is NOT a list of features _i.e._ these points are not required to be fulfilled by the future SWT implementation. They are _wishes_, they were prioritized by the people present at the event and they are only a list of points to be considered during the evaluation of the candidate technologies.

## The list
In order of importance (the most importants first), it would be nice if the next SWT port could...

1. Have a proper Browser integration
2. Be attractive to new Developers
3. Provide interoperability with the OS (_e.g._ Clipboard, handle links, D&D, etc)
4. _(these points are all tied in the 4th position)_ 
* * Have a good SWT-API-Compatibility-Level 
* * Perform well (fast)
* * Provide theming
